How to import the BH.UI package and successfully load the included ExampleMenu scene.

1) Import "DOTween Pro" (paid asset) from the Asset Store. This is a necessary dependency.
2) Set up DOTween Pro. In the "pro" section, only tick the "TextMesh Pro" box.
3) Import TMPEssentials. Creating any TextMeshPro object in the scene will prompt you to import this.
4) Import the BH.UI.unitypackage file.
5) Open the ExampleMenu scene located in Assets/BH.UI/Scenes.
