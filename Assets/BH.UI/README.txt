How to import the BH.UI package and successfully load the included ExampleMenu scene.

1) Import "DOTween Pro" (paid asset) from the Asset Store. This is a necessary dependency.
2) You will be prompted to set up DOTween Pro. While doing this, keep everything default except tick the "TextMesh Pro" box.
3) Import "TMP Essentials". Creating any TextMeshPro object in the scene will prompt you to import this.
4) Import the BH.UI.unitypackage file.
5) Open the ExampleMenu scene located in Assets/BH.UI/Scenes.
