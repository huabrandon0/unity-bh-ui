# unity-bh-ui
My implementation of UI buttons with animations in Unity. Made with **Unity version 2018.3.0f2**.

### Example scene

<p align="center">
  <img width="640" height="360" src="https://github.com/huabrandon0/unity-bh-ui/blob/master/gifs/unity-bh-ui-example-menu.gif"> </br>
</p>

Based on the Unity menu system tutorial [here][2].

### How to load up the example scene in Unity

1. Download the BH.UI.unitypackage file from the [releases][1].
2. Load up a new project in Unity.
3. Import "DOTween Pro" (paid asset, unfortunately) from the Asset Store. This is a necessary dependency.
4. You will be prompted to set up DOTween Pro. While doing this, keep everything default except tick the "TextMesh Pro" box.
5. Import "TMP Essentials". Creating any TextMeshPro object in the scene will prompt you to import this.
6. Import the BH.UI.unitypackage file.
7. Open the ExampleMenu scene located in Assets/BH.UI/Scenes.
